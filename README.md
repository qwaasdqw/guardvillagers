Are you tired of your village dying off because its golem is too lazy?

Are you tired of essentially defending it all by yourself?

This mod adds Guards as a solution, as well as new villager-related AI changes.

An * means a feature is configurable

<summary>Guard information</summary>

They spawn in villages in groups of six, equipped with either an iron sword or a crossbow. They're prepared to fight any threat to the village (possibly including you!). To make new guards, crouch and right click on a nitwit or unemployed villager with a sword or crossbow.

Guards can 'gossip' with villagers and will trust the player to open their inventory if they have a high enough reputation, have hero of the village, or was converted by the player. Right clicking will open up the guard inventory, allowing you to give them armor, and swap out their weapons! For their offhand slot, you can either give them a shield, or some food. If they have a shield, they will use it to block attacks. Crossbow guards with a shield won't be able to kick enemies if they're blocking. If they have food (or a potion), they will start eating or drinking if they are low on health.
If you have hero of the village, they will gain the ability to follow and fight for you when you click the follow button.

Players are able to make guards stand on a specific area by clicking on the 'patrol' button seen on the right. If the player has hero of the village, the 'follow' button, seen on the left, will be unlocked and as the name implies will allow guards to follow the player and fight for the player. Ringing a village bell with the hero of the village effect will also allow multiple guards in the bell's area to follow the player.

<summary>Frequently Asked Questions</summary>

Can you port to an older version/fabric?

No. Maintaining one version is hard enough already, and I've never learned fabric. However, the mod's license permits you to make ports yourself. A fabric version of this mod also currently exists.

Can you port to Windows 10 Edition/Xbox/Mobile?

No. Mods for the Bedrock ediiton use a completely different framework that I've also never learned. The mod's license allows you to try yourself, but since the modding API on Bedrock is less capable than forge you probably won't be able to replicate all of it.

Why don't guards have a workstation like other villager professions?

I haven't thought of a suitable block that would let you have a large number of guards without being inconvenient to store.

How would you make guards spawn with modded equipment?

You can make them spawn with modded equipment by making a datapack that overrides the guard_chestplate, guard_helmet, guard_legs, guard feet, guard_main_hand or guard_off_hand json files. 

Is this mod compatible with X?

Try and see!
